This repository will contain some of the code and models used in the paper **Data Science Approaches for Electrochemical Engineers â€“ An Introduction through Surrogate Model Development for Lithium-Ion Batteries**
by the above authors.  The only required packages are `scikit-learn`,  `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, and an anaconda environment `requirements.txt` is supplied.

A `jupyter notebook` is supplied, as well as a python file that creates an image of the plot from matplotlib.
